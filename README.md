user story:

From the landing page the user will see a navbar to navigate to other pages of the site. There will be a name logo on the left that will take the user back to the home page, and on the right there will be a link to the about page, to the projects page, and to the contact page. the about page will be a simple page with an image of the site's owner, and a brief bio. the projects page will be much more in depth. it will start with an index page showing an image of each project and its title. when clicked on, each project will have a show page with a longer description and a carousel with other images. the contact page will be a very basic page with just a few links to the owner's email, phone, and any other details desired. there will also be a hidden admin login page. this is where the owner will be able to enter their user and password to access functions of the site like create, update, and destroy.
